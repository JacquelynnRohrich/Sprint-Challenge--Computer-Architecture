# Architecture

#### Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
* Concurrent processing is a computing model in which multiple processors execute instructions simultaneously for better performance. Concurrent means something that happens at the same time as something else. Tasks are broken down into subtasks that are then assigned to separate processors to perform simultaneously, instead of sequentially as they would have to be carried out by a single processor. Concurrent processing is sometimes said to be synonymous with parallel processing.

#### Describe assembly language and machine language:
* An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer,or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

#### Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
